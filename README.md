## Feedback

"This presentation was delivered in-class with exceptional confidence, demonstrating excellent teaching and presentation skills.  It was clear, from the reaction of the other students, that they were not only impressed but were also learning from your implementation, especially those students who had not achieved as much.

The slides are mostly monochrome but there are some good examples given.

You have clearly understood the specification fully and have given a lot of thought to the process and how you could improve the GA in the future."
